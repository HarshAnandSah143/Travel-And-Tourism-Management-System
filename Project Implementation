* **Creatied the new project with JDK & IDE setup**
  The project was created using Java JDK 8 and developed using IntelliJ IDEA. All necessary
  environment variables were configured, and the project was initialized with proper directory
  structure.

*  The project structure**
  The project follows a modular MVC structure with separate packages for models, DAO, UI, and
  utility classes. This ensures clear separation of concerns and easy maintainability.

*  **Designed the database schema for the project**
  The database schema includes tables for Customers, Packages, Bookings, and Admin.
  Relationships are properly defined to support application functionality.

*  **Created a MySQL table**
  MySQL tables were created using travel\_tourism.sql, which defines and populates tables for
  customers, bookings, and tour packages.

*  **Implemented JDBC for database connectivity**
  The DBConnection.java utility class handles database connections using JDBC. Proper exception
  handling ensures reliable connectivity.

*  **Create Model, DAO classes for the database operations**
  Each table has corresponding model and DAO classes for encapsulating data and implementing
  CRUD operations. DAO classes abstract direct SQL interactions.

*  **Aesthetics and Visual Appeal of the UI**
  The UI is designed using Java Swing with consistent colors, fonts, and spacing. Icons and labels
  enhance usability.

*  **Component Placement and Alignment in the UI**
  Swing layout managers like GridBagLayout and BorderLayout are used for structured component
  placement. All buttons, labels, and fields are well-aligned.

*  **Responsiveness and Accessibility of the UI**
  The UI resizes appropriately with window resizing, and input fields support keyboard navigation.
  Tooltips and labels improve accessibility.
